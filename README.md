# A react project for football league

In this project we will be able to see different football teams of Spain league football. Fot example there are teams like Barcelona,Athletico Madrid. But Unfortunately Ream Madrid is absent from here because of the api. It allows you to work with only 50 teams.
# There are some teams which don't have any banner in the api so we will see some team details with banner and some without banner.

Not only that, with this project we will be able to know information about the respective clubs and it's description.

This project is built with React and React Router. There are bootstrap too and some fontawesome icons installed.
